        <h3>1. Good Layout</h3>        
        <a href="http://damndelicious.net/">

I chose damndelicious as my good example because A) it's a cooking website which requires a space as visually appealing as possible in order to intice use and B) it's instructional so it needs to have a very functional and readable quality to it. The homepage maintains consistent image sizes as well as proportional font sizing and spacing in my opinion.

One of the key points I understood from reading up on vertical rhythm was the importance of proportional values in regards to line-height and spacing. To find a bad example, I decided to look at old MySpace pages which gave users arguably too much freedom to manipulate their interface without really maintaining any proportional consistencies.        </p>
