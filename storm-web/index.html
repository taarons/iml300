   <p> My name is Tatiana Aarons and I feel like a pile of mice stacked on top if each other, covered in a trench coat, pretending to be a functioning human being. I love film and television, writing, and my friends. I also dislike some of my friends as well as loud chewers. I'd say my preferred creative media is video and my favorite applications are Spotify, Pinterest, and YouTube (is that considered an application?).</p>
